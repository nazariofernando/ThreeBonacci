# ThreeBonacci
Three-Bonacci practice problem for compsci competitions taken from ITMOx: I2CPx (edx.org)

This problem is about a funny extension of the well-known Fibonacci numbers, called Three-bonacci numbers. We define them as follows:
Ti = A0 (if i = 0), A1 (if i = 1), A2 (if i = 2), Ti-1 + Ti-2 - Ti-3 (if i>2), such that A0, A1 and A2 are given.

Input
The input file contains one line with four integer numbers, A0, A1, A2, and n. For these numbers, it holds that -10^3<=A0,A1,A2<=10^3 and 0<=n<=10^6.

Output
Output Tn in the first and only line of the output file.
